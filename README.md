### Problem Statement
- My Movies App - An app to check the latest popular or Top-rated movies.

- An app to show a list of movies from Movies DB(for ex Getting Started )

- There are two types of list should be shown 1. Top Rated 2. Popular movies. (You can design the UI as per your own wish. But both categories should visible & must be differentiated)

- Each card on the list should have the bare minimum details such as name, rating, language, image, year, etc.

- On tap of a movie card, it should go to movies details screen where the user can see further details of the movie in detail.

- From List they should be able to share the movie's details or link, if any, to friends via other social media apps.
